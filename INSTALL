Installation on most *nix boxes is as simple as:

# sudo ./setup.py install

But Ubuntu and Debian (starting with python-2.6) tend to modify
installation base from /usr to /usr/local thus making xyzcmd to crash at start.
So advised way of installation on these systems is to use a binary deb packages
available at http://code.google.com/p/xyzcmd/downloads/list or
to provide an additional flag to setup.py:

# ./setup.py install --install-layout=deb

For Ubuntu it is also possible to use PPA repo
 (currently for lucid and maverick):

1) sudo add-apt-repository ppa:syhpoon/xyzcmd
2) sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude install xyzcmd
